# Introduction to Python

This is a brief introduction to the Python programming language with a small emphasis on applications in finance.

## Following Along
Download the Jupyter Notebook file [here](python_for_finance_intro.ipynb).
You can then upload and run the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or 
[Jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/tree/).
The problems in 'problems.ipynb' can be solved directly in the notebook and are intended for 10-15 min during class.

The examples working with public data using the Coin Metric's API or downloading from the Open Source Asset Pricing 
Google Drive might seize to work at some point due to data availability.
I encourage you to explore alternative sources of data and modify the code accordingly :)
